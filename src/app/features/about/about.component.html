      <span style="font-size: 2rem">👋</span> Hi, I'm Yash, a
      <span>full stack software engineer</span>. My story with web development
      started when I tried to build a simple website<span
        style="font-size: 1.25rem"
        >💻</span
      >
      using HTML and CSS, seeing it come to life on a screen was exciting and
      ignited my passion for coding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspired by the endless possibilities of technology, I decided to dive
      deeper into computer engineering
      <span style="font-size: 1.5rem">🎓</span> in 2018, during engineering I
      learnt web and
      <span
        >built web application <span style="font-size: 1.5rem">📱</span></span
      >
      as college projects.

      During my graduation, I did internship at MobileComm Technologies

          >MobileComm India Pvt Ltd. <span style="font-size: 1.25rem">🏢</span></a
        ></span
      >
      in 2020(Nov-Dec) where I got opportunity to explore web development. I have to first prototype and then design a user friendly website for the Company with
      various modules assigned to me.
